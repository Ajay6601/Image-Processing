# Image-Processing

Image processing is the process of transforming an image into a digital form and performing certain operations to get some useful information from it. The image processing system usually treats all images as 2D signals when applying certain predetermined signal processing methods.

There are five main types of image processing:

Visualization - Find objects that are not visible in the image
Recognition - Distinguish or detect objects in the image
Sharpening and restoration - Create an enhanced image from the original image
Pattern recognition - Measure the various patterns around the objects in the image
Retrieval - Browse and search images from a large database of digital images that are similar to the original image.

In this repository we discuss about :

1.Blendind and color mapping
2.Image thresholding
3.Blurring and smoothing
4.Morphological operations
5.Gradients and Histograms
